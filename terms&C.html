            <br>
            <p>CityNest.com is an open venue for advertisers to post any advertisement related 
                to property sales/lettings in Sri Lanka. The website CityNest.com (the "Website") 
                is owned and operated by CityNest (Pvt) Ltd ("we" or "us"). We are not involved 
                in the content of the advertisements, the products or services being sold through the advertisements,
                or actual transactions between buyers and sellers through the advertisements. 
                Therefore, we have no control over the quality, safety or legality of the items offered, 
                the truth or accuracy of the listings.
                Our main service is listing the advertisements posted by advertisers. 
                Contacting an advertiser or reserving their services will be at your own discretion. 
                Once you have contacted the advertiser directly via email or telephone, 
                your contact with CityNest.com will cease to exist.

            <p>
                CityNest.com reserves the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to 
                refuse/delete/remove any advert for any reason or no reason. Such action will be taken mainly 
                on adverts that violate the Terms and Conditions, use inappropriate language or spam the site. 
            </p>
            <p>

                which were displayed on CityNest.com is solely between the Buyer (person who purchased the 
                service directly from the Seller) and Seller (person who sold/offered the service directly to the Buyer).
                We will not mediate any such dispute between Buyer and Seller, and cannot be held liable for any claim of loss,
                damages or wrongdoing on behalf of either the Buyer or Seller.

                or punitive damages, including without limitation liability for negligence for any damages whatsoever resulting 
                from any use of or inability to use this web site, loss of profit, loss of data, arising out of, based on,
